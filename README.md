# IS7012 Web Development in DotNet


<em>CoreWiki: IS7012-001 Assignment</em><br/>Your web application project name must be called CoreWiki. 
The CoreWiki folder must be located in your IS7012 repository. 
Your web application should consist of a home page (index.cshtml). <br/>
Tip: The index page is part of the default code and you can delete all of the content from
the default index.cshtml except for the first 5 lines.<br/>
a. The home page should contain a table that lists the 3 pages you will create
(see below). Your web application should consist of 3 additional pages. Each additional page
should consist of the following.<br/>
a. Find a http://wikipedia.org page that interests you.<br/>
b. Create a new page in your web application - name it appropriately for the
wikipedia content . E.g. if your wikipedia page is
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-by-one_error you might name your page
OffByOneError.cshtmlÂ <br/>
c. The first h1 element on the page should be the title of the wiki page.<br/>
d. Directly beneath the h1 header you will provide the link to the original wiki
page.<br/>
e. Directly beneath the link to the original wiki page you will output a horizontal
rule .<br/>
f. Copy the displayed content (not the HTML) or transcribe the contents from
the wikipedia page into your web application.<br/>
g. Use the appropriate HTML element to represent the document as closely as
possible to the original document .
